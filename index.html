      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Cows have been a presence in my life since birth — not just as livestock, but as gentle companions. While often underestimated, cows have quietly shaped my world, and my emotional landscape, in ways few can understand.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="connection">
      <h2>An Emotional Bond</h2>
      <p>Through the years, I have discovered that cows can read and respond to human emotion. A nuzzle when I’m low, a comforting lick on the hand, or the way they wrap their necks around me in a quiet hug — these gestures are more than animal instincts. They’re pure, empathic responses.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="shared-moments">
      <h2>Memories and Moments</h2>
      <p>From walking alongside them through golden fields to climbing mountains in peaceful company, cows have filled my days with stillness, joy, and meaning. Even in their silence, they communicate love and trust.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="why-it-matters">
      <h2>Why You Might Feel the Same</h2>
      <p>Cows offer more than milk or meat — they offer calm, grounding companionship. If given a chance, anyone can feel the deep, mutual understanding that comes from simply being present with them. They remind us to slow down, to feel, and to care.</p>
